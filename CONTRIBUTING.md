# Contributing to Magic Vault

Thanks for taking a look at contributing. This covers the dev workflow
for the three workspace packages (`shared`, `server`, `web`) and, in
particular, how to make and ship a database change safely.

## Getting set up

Follow the [Getting started](README.md#getting-started) and
[Setting up Neon](README.md#setting-up-neon) sections in the README
first — you'll need a Neon project (Postgres + pgvector + Neon Auth) and
a filled-in `.env` before anything here will run.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # turbo dev: Vite on :5173, Hono on :3001, in parallel
```

You can also run a single package's dev server with `--filter`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server dev
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/web dev
```

## Project layout

```
packages/
├── shared/   @magic-vault/shared - types, constants, evaluate-bin rule engine
├── server/   @magic-vault/server - Hono API, Drizzle schema/db, auth middleware
└── web/      @magic-vault/web    - React SPA (scanner, bins, collections, admin, build guide)
arduino/      Arduino sketch + wire protocol (arduino/PROTOCOL.md)
drizzle/      Generated SQL migrations (see Database changes below)
```

Branch off `master` and open pull requests against `master`.

## `packages/shared`

Framework-agnostic types, constants, and the `evaluate-bin` rule engine
used by both the server and the web app. It has no build step of its own
— both other packages resolve `@magic-vault/shared` straight to
`src/index.ts` via the pnpm workspace link, so a change here is picked
up immediately by whichever dev server you have running, no rebuild
needed.

Keep this package free of server-only (Node/Drizzle) or web-only
(React/DOM) dependencies — anything that needs those belongs in `server`
or `web` instead, even if it feels shared in spirit.

## `packages/server`

Hono 4 API. Each resource gets its own route file in `src/routes/`
(`bins.ts`, `collections.ts`, `feeder.ts`, etc.), registered in
`src/index.ts` **without** an `/api` prefix — the web app's Vite dev
proxy adds that prefix and strips it back off before forwarding, so
routes should assume they're mounted at the bare resource path
(`/collections`, not `/api/collections`).

Auth/RLS: `db` (from `src/db/index.ts`) is a plain connection — use
`authQuery(jwtClaims, tx => ...)` for anything scoped to the calling
user/org, which sets the RLS JWT claims and switches to the
`authenticated` Postgres role for that transaction. Use the plain `db`
export directly only for operations that intentionally bypass RLS
(background jobs, webhook lookups, etc.).

There's no `lint` script for this package — rely on your editor's
TypeScript diagnostics, and make sure `pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server build` (tsup) still succeeds before opening a PR.

## `packages/web`

React 19 + Vite + React Router v7, structured feature-first
(Bulletproof React style): each feature under `src/features/<name>/`
owns its own `api/`, `components/`, and `lib/` subfolders. Only
genuinely cross-feature code belongs in the top-level `components/`,
`hooks/`, or `lib/` directories. Import via the `@/*` alias
(`@/features/...`, `@/lib/...`), not relative paths that climb out of a
feature folder.

Any form should use React Hook Form + a Zod resolver
(`useForm` + `zodResolver`) — avoid hand-rolled `useState`-per-field
forms.

```bash
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/web lint    # eslint
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/web build   # tsc -b && vite build - also the source of truth for type errors
```

## Database changes

Schema changes need a migration — **don't hand-edit anything under
`drizzle/`**, it's generated output.

1. Edit `packages/server/src/db/schema.ts`. New tables that hold
   user/org data should follow the existing pattern of `.enableRLS()`
   plus a `crudPolicy({ role: authenticatedRole, ... })` entry, mirroring
   a neighboring table rather than inventing a new access pattern.
2. Generate the migration from your schema diff:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:generate
   ```
   This writes a new numbered `.sql` file (and updates
   `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` + a matching snapshot) under `drizzle/`.
3. **Read the generated SQL before applying it.** Drizzle's diffing is
   usually right but not infallible, especially for renames (which it
   can see as a drop + add) — fix the migration file by hand if that
   happens rather than accepting data loss.
4. Apply it to your own database:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:migrate
   ```
   During fast local iteration on a schema that hasn't been finalized
   yet, `pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:push` (schema pushed
   directly, no migration file) is faster — but before opening a PR,
   make sure there's a real migration generated via `db:generate` that
   matches your final schema, since `db:push` alone leaves nothing for
   anyone else (or the deploy pipeline) to apply.
5. Commit `schema.ts` together with the generated `drizzle/*.sql` and
   `drizzle/meta/*` files in the same PR. Reviewers should be able to
   see the SQL, not just the Drizzle schema diff.
6. If your change references anything Neon Auth provides (the `auth`
   schema, the `authenticated` role, `auth.user_id()`/`auth_is_org_member()`),
   remember that only exists on a database that's had Neon Auth enabled
   — see the [Neon setup](README.md#setting-up-neon) note about this
   ordering.

`pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:studio` opens Drizzle Studio if
you want to poke at the database directly while iterating.

## Opening a PR

- Keep PRs scoped to one change — a schema migration that also
  refactors unrelated code makes the migration harder to review.
- Call out in the PR description if a change touches the Arduino
  protocol (`arduino/PROTOCOL.md` / `arduino/main/main.ino`) — firmware
  and the app's serial layer need to stay in sync, and the firmware
  can't be hot-reloaded the way the app can.
